*			SEARCH ALGORITHM
Search algorithm is an algorithm used to solve search problems. It retrieves information stored within a particular data structure. The appropriate search algorithm to use often depends on the data structure being searched and may also include prior knowledge about the data.
They can be made faster or more efficient by specially constructed database structures e.g search trees, hash maps and database indexes.

Search Algorithms can be classified into three types:
	- Linear
	- Binary
	- Hashing
